  <h5>About Ionic Components</h5>
  <p>
    Ionic apps are made of high-level building blocks called components. Components allow you to quickly construct an interface for your app. Ionic comes with a number of components, including modals, popups, and cards. Check out the examples below to see what each component looks like and to learn how to use each one. Once youâ€™re familiar with the basics, head over to the <a href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/api">API docs</a> for ideas on how to customize each component.
