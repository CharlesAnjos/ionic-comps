  <p>
    Alerts are a great way to offer the user the ability to choose 
    a specific action or list of actions. They also can provide 
    the user with important information, or require them to make 
    a decision (or multiple decisions).
  </p>
  <p>
    From a UI perspective, Alerts can be thought of as a type 
    of “floating” modal that covers only a portion of the screen. 
    This means Alerts should only be used for quick actions like 
    password verification, small app notifications, or quick 
    options. More in depth user flows should be reserved for 
    full screen ​<a href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/components/#modals">Modals</a>​.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alerts are quite flexible, and can easily be customized.

  <h5>
    Basic Alert
  </h5>
  <p>
    Basic Alerts are typically used to notify the user about 
    new information (a change in the app, a new feature, etc), 
    an urgent situation that requires acknowledgement, or as a 
    confirmation to the user that an action was successful or 
    not.
  </p>

  <h5>
    Prompt Alert
  </h5>
  <p>
    Prompts offer a way to input data or information. Often times 
    Prompts will be used to ask the user for a password before 
    moving forward in an application’s flow.

  <button ion-button block color="dark" (click)="doPromptAlert()">

  <h5>
    Confirmation Alert
  </h5>
  <p>
    Confirmation Alerts are used when it is required that the 
    user explicitly confirms a particular choice before 
    progressing forward in the app. A common example of the 
    Confirmation Alert is checking to make sure a user wants 
    to delete or remove a contact from their address book.
